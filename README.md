# FlySafe.ai ‚úàÔ∏è

**FlySafe.ai** is a personal AI-powered inspection agent that uses **Amazon Nova Pro** and **Amazon Nova Sonic** to assist with **video analysis**, **natural language interaction**, and **tool-based automation**.

Here's the video [demo](https://youtu.be/d1ixI9FTxuo).

## Features ‚ú®

### Video Analysis (Nova Pro)
- Uses the **Amazon Nova Pro** model to analyze inspection videos.
- Automatically generates a detailed **inspection report**.

### Conversational Agent (Nova Sonic)

  - Answer **user questions** about the inspection.
  - Perform **tool-based actions** using integrated APIs.

## Tool-Calling Functionalities üîß

### 1. Google Shopping Search 
- Triggered when the user asks the agent to look for any **replacement parts or products**.
- Uses the **SERP API** to fetch and display the **top 3 results** from Google Shopping.

### 2. Invoice Generation 
- Based on the selected product from the search results.
- Automatically generates a PDF invoice with the relevant info

### 3. Email Sending 
- Uses the **SendGrid API**.
- Sends the **generated invoice PDF** and the **conversation transcript** to the user‚Äôs email on confirmation
